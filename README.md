# MNIST Classification in JAX (Haiku and Optax)

This repository combines the example MNIST classification programs from the JAX, Haiku, and Optax libraries into a single notebook.
The purpose is to provide a reference implementation for myself (or others) to use when building new models.

## Installation

The following packages are required to run the notebook:

- JAX (`jax`)
- Haiku (`dm-haiku`)
- Optax (`optax`)

All of the dependencies can be installed using `pip` from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
